## Comprehensive VPN Configuration Using IP XFRM and Network Namespaces in Kali Linux

This project is centered on the practical implementation of VPN configurations, utilizing
 ip xfrm as the primary VPN solution. Additionally, Linux namespaces will be employed to
 construct and manage a complex network topology within a Kali Linux virtual machine.
 The goal is to create a comprehensive example that covers all potential VPN configuration
 scenarios, demonstrating the versatility and functionality of VPN technologies in a controlled
 environment.
